# World Happiness Report

This repository contains data analysis and reports on the Happiness Score dataset found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Funsdsn%2Fworld-happiness%2Fversion%2F2) in order to determine both a Linear and Multilayer Perceptron Model which are comparable in performance based on the RMSE metric.

## Pre-Requisites:
* Python 3
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-Learn
* Jupyter Notebook
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Files:
* Plots.ipynb -> contains data analysis for selecting proper feature attributes
* Results_6_Features.ipynb -> contains Linear and MLP models with relevant for total 6 features considered.
* Three_Feature_Results.ipynb -> contains the linear and MLP models for the best three feature subset selected based on the data analysis carried out before.
* Three_Bad_Features -> contains the models with relevant results for the least desirable features.

## Execution:
* The Dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle link given above and extracted to the same folder.
* All the python notebooks can be executed normally with Jupyter Notebook Setup.
